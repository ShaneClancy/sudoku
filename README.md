React project for a web-based sudoku experience.

## Goals
The goal for this project were to be able to learn the basics of React and to be able to build a somewhat complicated component dependent single page application.

## Challenges
 - Being able to create a game-board with an efficient algorithm took a lot of time to design.
 - Creating a component dynamic in which the parent controlled all of the actions of the children was complex.
